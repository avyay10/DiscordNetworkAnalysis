# Discord Data-Based Network Analysis

## Introduction
Discord is a popular communication platform that is often used by communities, such as gaming communities, to interact with each other. Discord generates a lot of text data, and this data can be analyzed to extract insights into the community's behavior and structure. In this project, we aim to perform a network analysis of a Discord community's text data to visualize their communication network, calculate betweenness and centrality, and extract insights from the analysis.

## Methodology
The methodology for this project involves the following steps:

1. Collect the text data from the Discord server using the Discord API and a bot account.
2. Preprocess the text data by cleaning it, removing stop words, and tokenizing it.
3. Build a co-occurrence matrix to represent the relationships between the users based on the frequency of their interactions.
4. Use the co-occurrence matrix to build a graph and visualize the communication network using a plotting library like NetworkX.
5. Calculate betweenness and centrality measures for each user to identify key influencers in the network.
6. Extract insights from the network analysis.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Python
- Discord API
- discord.py (Python library for accessing the Discord API)
- Pandas (Python library for data manipulation)
- NLTK (Python library for natural language processing)
- NetworkX (Python library for graph analysis)

## Results and Discussion
The results of the network analysis will depend on the data collected and the community being analyzed. However, the goal of this project is to provide a starting point for analyzing the communication network of a Discord community using text.
